            <p>For my semester one refelction, I've chosen to code a website. The purpose of this site is to be easily accessible to learn about the course, as my intended audience is future 21st Century World Lit students. </p>
            <p>I felt that a website is the medium to reflect through: it perfectly encompasses the ideas of the world within "World Literature" - on today's globe, websites are the crux of interconnectivity.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>There should be a line connecting Kabul to Fremont, showing Amir's two journeys to the US</li>
                <li>Zoom into both the green and purple pinpoints to watch Reyna's and Amir's journeys.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So far, our eyes and ears have gone on a journey to <i>eighteen</i> countries. </p>
            <p>Before I discuss the lessons that have followed me throughout the first semester, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the goals of 21st Century World Literature. On the first day, we were told that we’d be reading stories from around the world. None of us understood the journey we were about to embark on: falling in love with stories from around the world, immersing ourselves in the environments we barely scratch the surface of through reading the news. When I first chose to take this course I can’t honestly say I aimed to broaden my horizons. In fact, I had no idea I would. All I knew was that I’d be reading award winning books, and boy I was wrong. This was my single story. My new understanding can best be put in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s words: start with “secondly” instead of from the beginning because the beginning sets one context. “Firstly, you’ll be reading world-renowned literature.” “Secondly, you’ll become invested in the characters, feeling their happiness and pain, yearning for their joy." The books are award winning because they allowed me to travel across the globe in hours. I’ve realized now that these stories have expanded my perspective. Initially, the extent of my insight into global conflicts was CNN and Stephen Colbert. I thought I had the complete story in front of me, and I accordingly felt that I wasn’t equipped to aid my fellow global citizens, because their struggles were conflicts too great for me to even begin to tackle.</p></div>

                <h3>The world is a <b>big</b> place, and its citizens have incredible stories filled with tears and smiles. The first semester gave me a new perspective: encouraging me to look past the news cycle and political jargon. As global citizens, our goal is to understand these stories to become equipped to improve our globe. </h3>

            <p>I've been lucky to travel the world. By the age of ten, I'd traveled to France, Kenya, Tanzania, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, and India. Next summer, I'll visit Australia, South America, and Antarctica. I can’t overstate the fact that the world is a massive place. To most people, this isn’t a concept ingrained in their daily lives, and honestly, my flights across the Atlantic and Pacific don't truly do justice to the massiveness of the world. Specifically, while the world may be massive in its physical expanse of endless landscapes and biomes, its enormity comes from its inhabitants. Us humans, we’re diverse creatures. Our brains have near endless capacity, and we’re capable of doing amazing things. From bettering each other’s lives with each day by helping a homeless man or designing the next generation of neurosurgeries, to re-engineering our physical world by constructing cities and civilizations, every one of the 8 billion people on this Earth have complex thought processes and diverse backgrounds that are underappreciated in daily life.</p>

                <p class="w3-text">  <p>The first semester of 21st Century World Literature has allowed me to begin to grasp appreciating the diversity of our human race while opening my eyes to the true shortcomings that comprise single stories. When we began our introduction to the Kite Runner, Ms. Sautter reiterated our impression of Afghanistan: “THE GRAVEYARD OF EMPIRES.” AH! SCARY! A war stricken country brimming with refugees. AP World History, a class embedded in many students’ curricula, reflects the same sentiment: Afghanistan is a failed country where the US swept in and saved everyone. Even <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=afganistan&tbm=isch&sxsrf=AJOqlzXDvIEO_-TcHLs5I5ELhmgPSgcFrw%3A1673649837765&source=hp&biw=1256&bih=795&ei=rd7BY6aqLIaZptQPib60oAg&iflsig=AK50M_UAAAAAY8HsvV5zLiMJhGtTrOKnPhyhdx12_o7E&oq=Afga&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgQIIxAnMggIABCABBCxAzIFCAAQgAQyCAgAEIAEELEDMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEOggIABCxAxCDAToLCAAQgAQQsQMQgwFQAFiVBGD4CmgAcAB4AIABU4gBuQKSAQE0mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&sclient=img" target="_blank">Google Images</a> tells you that Afghanistan is filled with bloodshed and violence. This is our single story. Our world is big, and even though others experience pain, they have happiness too. To many of us, the idea of happiness ever existing in Afghanistan was practically nonexistent. Yet, somehow, when Hosseini writes of the celebration, happiness, and connection that comes from kite running, it turns from a foreign concept to an activity we’re invested in.
                The community connection that comes from kite fighting is just as familiar as our Fourth of July celebrations.

                <p>Be honest. With a few word replacements, we're right back at home in the US. This just goes to show that our home isn't as unique as we perceive it to be, with its tight-knit communities and loving families, and Afghanistan isn't filled with just blood and tears. It has joy and grins just the same. Firstly, I feel that the Kite Runner perfectly represents our misconception from our single stories. Additionally, it opened my eyes to the incredible communities that exist within our world. Although I’m a minority within Clifton Park, I’ve been introduced to the idea that Indian and South Asian/Middle Eastern communities exist all throughout the United States, but most of the time they’re attributed to New Jersey, Texas, and California. Specifically, I’m told that the “brown kids” go to Princeton, MIT, and Stanford from those states respectively. Not to say I’m blinded by the stereotype that my culture is strictly composed of doctors and engineers, but I was yet to come across a book written by a brown author, such as the Kite Runner, without seeking one out. Honestly, the idea of reading a world-renowned story by a brown author was a little eye-opening for me. In fact, it reaffirms the fact that the world is a MASSIVE place. Anyone can be anything. Anyone can write a meaningful story that changes the perspectives and worldviews of others. This is where I aspire to begin my second semester. I aspire to continue to change my own perspective as I work to change that of others. So far, one way my own perspective has changed has been by gaining a deeper understanding of the true conflict that occurs within the Middle East. All my life, I’ve been told “the bad Taliban showed up, and that’s why we’ve been at war for 30 years.” I’ve been taught that Afghanistan is a failed country. US politicians chalk up refugee crises to “not being their problem” when in fact as global citizens, it’s everyone’s problem. The Kite Runner gave me a deeper insight into exactly what the Afghan people are escaping. The War on Terror has been the conflict of my lifetime, and with a deeper understanding of the people and families being torn apart, I’m equipped to find a way to help, whether advocating to my local politicians, donating to charities, or just helping out local refugees.

                <p class="w3-text">Funnily enough, the Distance Between Us is <i>literally</i> about the almost incomprehensible size of the world. As Reyna reminisces about her parents upon being left behind in Mexico, and eventually travels from her home to El Otro Lado, she’s given daily reminders about how large the world is. But, Reyna’s siblings help reconcile her pain given by the distance that separates her family. There are 1,949 miles between Iguala and Los Angeles. If I were to run at a seven minute mile pace every hour for a week straight, I still wouldn’t have traveled that distance. Physically, it’s impossible for a young child to make that journey without help. As we saw, for an impoverished family, that’s nearly impossible. But, Reyna and Mago managed to travel that distance with their minds, just as we’ve begun to this past semester:
                    <br><br>“Mago touched my belly button and added something to the story my mother had never told me. She said that my umbilical cord was like a ribbon that connected me to Mami. She said, "It doesn't matter that there's a distance between us now. That cord is there forever.”<br><br>

                    By developing a metaphorical connection to her parents, Reyna adapts to their separation. As I’m examining my own future separation from my family (college, future jobs) it’s worth remembering how Reyna handled it. Moreso, once Reyna was finally with her family, she returned to both tears and smiles. Whether diving into the ocean with her father, or being on the other end of his belt, Reyna continued to persevere through her pain. As a global citizen, Reyna’s story has equipped me with a broader perspective. During a <i>certain someone’s</i> presidency, Mexican immigrants were a major point of political tension. They were described as “rapists and cartels who come to steal American jobs.” Yet, the Distance Between us flips that stereotype on its head: “all I could think of was why there’d be a law that would prevent children from being with their father. That was the only reason I’d come to this country, after all … Please God, let us arrive safely to El Otro Lado. I want to live in that perfect place. I want to have a father. I want to have a family.” Illegal immigrants face pain and death crossing the border, walking hundreds of miles on foot to just have a family. I’ve grown up with two parents home each day when I return from school. The Distance Between us showed me a story of a family that’s torn apart and sewn together constantly. I’ve gained a deeper perspective, and realize that I can’t necessarily take the word of the “trusted officials of the government” at face value. It’s my responsibility to look deeper, past the stereotyped malice, to understand the tears and trauma of Mexican families.
